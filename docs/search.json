    "text": "We, the employees of the Urban Institute, believe strongly in its promise of a workplace where ‚Äúall staff feel respected, heard, engaged, and valued‚Äù. Our union is motivated both by our commitment to Urban‚Äôs mission of bringing rigorous research to policy debates and by our commitment to improving Urban by ensuring it is an inclusive and nurturing workplace for all employees. We believe that nobody can represent workers‚Äô interests better than workers themselves and that our perspectives are vital to Urban‚Äôs longevity and its institutional ethics. And we believe that until we unite to strengthen our voices and decisionmaking power in conversation with management, Urban cannot make good on the workplace it promises.\nAs a union we commit to centering and supporting our Black, Brown, Indigenous, and Latinx colleagues; our queer and trans colleagues; and our colleagues with disabilities. We commit to being intentional about racial progress in performing our work, promoting a culture in which everyone is welcome to bring their full selves into work, and fighting for each other‚Äôs well-being through equitable pay, treatment, promotion processes, leadership, and mental health resources at Urban.\nTogether we will:\n\nCreate Accountable Treatment and Compensation Structures\nPromote Transparency in Institutional Decisionmaking\nPrioritize Diversity and Inclusion\nDevelop More Equitable Partnerships with Communities\nBoost Morale"
