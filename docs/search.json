    "text": "Collective bargaining is the formal process employees in unions and their employers use to negotiate the terms and conditions of work‚Äîincluding wages, benefits, and working conditions. The terms agreed upon during collective bargaining are solidified in a contract called the collective bargaining agreement (CBA).\nThe bargaining phase is eight steps:\n\nBargaining Committee Formation - represents the unit‚Äôs interests in bargaining and negotiates a collective bargaining agreement with management\nSurvey - sent to the entire unit to gather information on the unit‚Äôs priorities\nRequest for Information - gather facts from the employer to prior to negotiations\nDraft Articles - As a bargaining committee we will draft sections of the contract we will bargain over. For example, we will write out our workplace benefits to present to Exec. Ground Rules Bargaining - guidelines that provides structure and process during bargaining\nCBA Bargaining - organized contract around key priorities of the unit Ratification Vote - the unit votes to approve or reject a CBA\nCBA Signing by Unit, NPEU President, & Urban management - a celebration should follow; it‚Äôs a big deal!\n\nNegotiations begin with current pay and benefits as the baseline. Members identify which issues are most important to them; areas that need improvement are often prioritized in bargaining. Negotiations can include anything that affects the conditions of your employment. While management is only legally obligated to bargain on wages, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment, many NPEU members bargain on other important topics such as racial equity, professional development, and workplace democracy.\n\n\n\nWe are currently in the status quo period with management before we have negotiated a first contract. During the status quo period, management can‚Äôt make changes to the terms and conditions of your employment without notifying and bargaining with the union about these changes and their effects. That includes changes around issues like hours, wages, departmental procedures, benefits, leave, overtime, etc. The employer is also prohibited from conducting layoffs or furloughs without consulting and bargaining with the union on the impact of such decisions. Processes including raises, promotions, new hires, changing supervisors are NOT FROZEN in the status quo period, or after the status quo period.\n\n\n\nThe bargaining unit is the group of employees at a workplace that make up the union. Generally, they share a ‚Äúcommunity of interest‚Äù (similar occupations, geographic location, duties, payment structure, review/rating system, etc.). A bargaining unit can include all the employees in a given office (i.e., wall-to-wall unit) or a set of occupations (e.g., professionals, clerical, technical, etc.). Most NPEU member organizations have ‚Äúwall-to-wall‚Äù bargaining units that represent staff in all departments.\n\n\n\nThe Bargaining Committee (BC) is a group of 11 self-nominated members representing a variety of roles, centers, and affinity groups. The BC works with representatives from the Nonprofit Professional Employees Union (NPEU) to prepare for negotiating a bargaining contract with executive management. There is opportunity for all union members to be involved with the bargaining process - email urbaninstituteunion@gmail.com if you are interested in helping with bargaining tasks and union engagement."

    "title": "FAQs",
    "section": "BARGAINING",
    "text": "BARGAINING\n\nWhat is the process of drafting a collective bargaining agreement?\nEmployees in unions and their employers can tailor the contract to the needs of their organization and its employees. A contract can include provisions such as improved wages, better benefits, greater work-life balance, professional development opportunities, protections that ensure fair and equal treatment, and other workplace improvements. We will work closely with our parent union NPEU to draft our collective bargaining agreement. NPEU has examples of previous contracts from other organizations to serve as guides for our contracts and lawyers to ensure our contract language meets legal benchmarks.\n\n\nWhat are some of our Union‚Äôs goals?\nWe are collaboratively working together to identify our goals as a union. Here are some of the issues we‚Äôve identified and seek to address so far:\n\nEnhance Diversity and Inclusion: We can‚Ä¶ build on past efforts to enhance diversity, commit greater resources and authority to workers, and dismantle existing policies and norms that disadvantage people of marginalized identities. People of marginalized identities have different experiences working at Urban than their more privileged peers. We want all Urban employees, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, physical ability, or sexual orientation to feel like their contributions are valued, heard, and respected.\nPromote Transparency: We can‚Ä¶ increase transparency in institutional decision making, facilitate more inclusive discussions of workplace issues between management and staff, better align Urban‚Äôs internal practices with its mission, and set consistent policies across the institute so all workers at Urban can thrive. Urban values respect, honesty, opportunity, and collaboration. While Urban strives to honor these values in its research, it must work with intention to do the same in its internal structure and treatment of its own workers.\nEnsure Equitable Decision Making: We can‚Ä¶ require worker input in all major institutional decisions, ensure that organizational policies are fair to all employees, and hold managers accountable to good supervision. Equity is about sharing power. Urban is committed to equity and improving lives. To ensure a better workplace, Urban needs to allow workers a stronger voice and clear authority in institutional decision making.\nFair Treatment and Compensation: We can‚Ä¶ foster a more respectful workplace, ensure everyone is fairly compensated for their work, and address concerns, grievances, and supervisory issues in a transparent and fair manner. Someone‚Äôs experience at Urban shouldn‚Äôt be dictated by their tenure, supervisor, or center or office. Everyone deserves a fair workplace.\nMore Equitable Partnerships with Communities: We can ‚Ä¶more wholly invest in the communities we work with, reduce extractive research methods, and include and compensate community members in our work. We want all our work at Urban to live up to our mission to ‚Äúinform consequential choices about the well-being of people‚Ä¶in the United States‚Äù while enriching the lives of communities we work with.\nBoost Morale: We can‚Ä¶ reduce burnout, improve work-life balance, increase retention, improve research, and foster trust and fairness in the workplace. We want all Urban employees to have the resources and support to contribute to Urban‚Äôs work.\n\nThese goals will continue to evolve as we survey unit members and get a better sense of the kinds of changes we want to see at Urban.\n\n\nWhat can we ask for?\nEmployees in unions and their employers tailor their contract to the needs of their organization and its employees. Broadly, unions have legal status and power to effect change in a work environment. As long as there is a union, employers cannot unilaterally dictate wages, benefits, and other workplace policies. A contract can include provision categories such as:\n\nImproved salary and promotion policies\nProfessional development opportunities\nProcesses to collaborate with managers\nHealth care, retirement, vacation time, sick leave, and paid family leave\nHiring, firing, disciplinary, and promotion policies\nTelework, flex time, and overtime policies\nStaff representation in strategic decisions, including Board participation\nPolicies to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion for staff based on race or ethnicity, gender, and disability status\nProtections against harassment\n\nFurthermore, after recognition but before a contract is finalized, there is a grace period granting workers additional protections and requiring management to consult the unit on decisions that will affect union staff. As an internal body with legal bargaining power, we will function as a check on our organization and will act as an accountability mechanism. Outside of contract negotiations, our union will allow us to put our metaphorical weight behind our recommendations, requests, and support for specific initiatives.\n\n\nHow much are dues and how do they work?\nNPEU dues are 0.75% of pre-tax wages (about $30/month for someone making $50,000/year). Dues aren‚Äôt collected until after the first contract is negotiated and ratified. All NPEU members pay dues through the standard direct deposit/payroll process at their workplace. These dues pay for:\n\nMembership to the Local (NPEU), the International (IFPTE), and the AFL-CIO\nAccess to legal, training, bargaining, and support services from the Local and International\nAccess to NPEU events and annual meetings\nDiscretionary funds for events and solidarity activities (last year some these funds went to support BLM protests in DC)\nAssistance if your employer violates your union contract\n\nGenerally these dues are more than offset by raises and additional benefits negotiated by the Union."

    "section": "UNION MEMBERSHIP",
    "text": "UNION MEMBERSHIP\n\nWho at Urban is included in our bargaining unit?\nManagerial authority differs by career track. We worked with people in each center and office and management to draw a line at what steps should, at minimum, be included in the union. For example, communications staff step one through four are automatically included in the union. Management also reserves the right to exclude certain people from the unit if they are privileged employees or require folks to sign NDAs before signing the unit. If you have any questions about your specific inclusion in the unit, get in touch with us!\nTrack Minimum Step Included:\n\nAccounting & Finance: Step 4\nCenter Operations: Step 5\nCommunications: Step 4\nDevelopment: Step 4\nExecutive Office: Step 3\nFacilities & Office Services: Step 4\nGrants and Contracts: Step 4\nHuman Resources: Step 3\nLibrarian: Step 3\nResearch, Policy, TTA: Step 3\nTech and Data: Step 4\n\n\n\nWhat happens if someone is promoted out of the unit?\nIf someone is promoted to a step in their career track that exceeds the maximum step for eligibility, they will no longer be included in the unit. While they are not afforded the same benefits established in the CBA, Urbanites outside the bargaining unit have knowledge and connections are key to the success of the union. You are senior leaders who have power to support non-managerial staff through:\n\nAdvice or Guidance: As a leader at Urban, you have more experience with our institution and know more about its inner workings. You have knowledge that would be great to pass onto any members of the BC.\nSupport: You can be integral to the movement by publicly supporting the union and our efforts!\nOutreach: If you know someone new in your center who is included in the bargaining unit, you can reach out to a member of the BC to help us get in contact with them.\n\nAdditionally, we hope that the improvements we bargain for will have positive spillover effects to everyone at Urban and not just those in the unit.\n\n\nHow many people are in our Union?\nAs of 2022-11-05, there are 262 people in our unit."

    "section": "YOUR RIGHTS",
    "text": "YOUR RIGHTS\n\nAre there potential repurcussions from publicly discussing or supporting the Union?\nWe have won the right to be proud and open about our union! And, it is illegal for an employer to retaliate against staff for working together to improve their workplace, including joining a union. Management and supervisory staff can‚Äôt actively dissuade staff from participating in a unionizing effort and they can‚Äôt reward staff for not participating. If you are still concerned about anonymity or your privacy and the bargaining process, please reach out to any member of the BC or send an email to urbaninstituteunion@gmail.com. Additionally, over 140 senior staff (who are not part of the union) signed a letter in support of our union. You can find the letter (and your supervisors name or absence here).\n\n\nWhat legal protections do I have?\nJoining together with your coworkers to organize a union is a fundamental right recognized in U.S. labor law. It‚Äôs even affirmed in the United Nations‚Äô Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Under the National Labor Relations Act, you have the right to:\n\nJoin a union\nTalk to your coworkers and participate in meetings to discuss joining a union or other collective efforts to improve your workplace (outside of work hours)\nOrganize fellow employees, support the union, and distribute literature and membership cards to be signed\nSign a union membership card and demand employer recognition of your union\nWear buttons, stickers, T-shirts, etc. in support of the union\nFile complaints against your company if they are in violation of these rights\n\n\n\nDoes our union mean that I can‚Äôt go directly to my supervisor with an issue\n? No! You can continue to talk to your supervisor or VP directly about any issues at work‚Äîthough it may not always get results. When you are represented, your union can help you talk with management on equal footing and with the support of your colleagues behind you.\n\n\nWhen should I reach out to the Union versus HR?\nIf you have an administrative HR question/concerns about current policies (ie about your payband, timing of direct deposits, backpay, etc) you should reach out to HR.\nIf you have concerns with current policies, or thoughts for how to make them better/more equitable, you can reach out to the BC. If you have reached out to HR and haven‚Äôt received a timely response or have concerns that they are not following current policies you can also reach out to us."

    "section": "SURVEY",
    "text": "SURVEY\n\nHow will anonymity be protected on the survey?\nIt is important for us to ask demographic questions on the bargaining survey to ensure that our CBA includes priorities of traditionally deprioritized groups at Urban. However most of the demographic questions are optional. Individual answers to survey questions will NOT be viewed by anyone outside of the BC. All information presented back to the union will be aggregated and de-identified. We are creating a community of trust and hope that everyone feels comfortable taking the survey. If you do not, you can definitely provide feedback on policies you like/want to see changed by getting in touch with any individual member of the BC who will report back anonymously.\n\n\nHow long will the bargaining survey be fielded?\nThe survey will be open for three to four weeks. If the time frame does not work for you, please let us know and we will try to accommodate you. However, the sooner we have everyone‚Äôs response, the quicker we can get to bargaining!\nUpdate: The survey is closed as of Dec 2021.\n\n\nI joined Urban after the survey was fielded, can I provide feedback on priorities?\nIf you have feedback on specific policies you want to see changed at Urban, please get in touch with us via email or reach out to a member of the BC directly.\n\n\nHow can I view the results of the survey?\nThe BC presented the big picture aggregated results of the survey in our February 2022 Town Hall.
